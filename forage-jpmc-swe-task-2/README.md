# JPMorgan Virtual Internship - Task 2

In this repository, I've documented my completion of Task 2 of the virtual internship at JPMorgan. Below, I'll outline what I learned, the technologies I used, and the tasks I completed.

## What I Learned
- **Setting up npm**: I learned how to install npm to work with JavaScript, a crucial skill for web development.
- **Utilizing Perspective**: I gained an understanding of why JPMorgan Chase developed Perspective and made it available as an open-source library.
- **Developing with React**: Through modifying React components (`App.tsx` and `Graph.tsx`), I improved my skills in building dynamic user interfaces.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: I worked with React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript was utilized for its strong type checking, enhancing the robustness of the codebase.
- **npm**: I installed npm to manage packages and dependencies for the project.
- **Web Assembly**: Perspective leverages Web Assembly for high-performance data visualization.
- **Apache Arrow**: Apache Arrow is used by Perspective for efficient data manipulation.

## Task Summary
### Objective
- **Continuous Data Visualization**: I modified the application to continuously update the graph, providing a live visualization of stock data.
- **Data Filtering**: I implemented functionality to remove duplicated data entries, ensuring data accuracy and efficiency.

### Task Details
1. **Setting up Dev Environment**: I followed instructions to set up the local development environment for the program, ensuring smooth execution of the tasks.
2. **Modifying `App.tsx`**: I made changes to `App.tsx` to enable continuous data streaming and conditional rendering of the graph component.
3. **Modifying `Graph.tsx`**: I updated `Graph.tsx` to configure the Perspective viewer element for desired data visualization, including setting up row and column pivots and defining aggregates.

## Conclusion
Completing Task 2 of the JPMorgan virtual internship provided me with valuable insights into web development with React and TypeScript. By leveraging npm and understanding the intricacies of Perspective, I enhanced my skills in front-end development and data visualization. The experience of setting up a local development environment and implementing dynamic features has expanded my proficiency in software engineering practices.
