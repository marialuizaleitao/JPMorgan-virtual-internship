# JPMorgan Virtual Internship - Task 1

## Overview
This folder contains the first task for the JPMorgan Virtual Internship, focusing on software engineering. In Task 1, we addressed the development of a chart for a trader's dashboard to identify under/over-valued stocks. This involved interfacing with a stock price data feed, fixing issues in the client datafeed script, and optionally adding unit tests.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the role of Software Engineers in assisting JPMorgan Chase traders by building dashboards.
- Set up a local development environment by installing Python, forking/cloning the starter repository, and installing project dependencies.
- Gain familiarity with engineering tickets and the process of resolving them.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Git/GitHub

## Tasks Completed
1. **Setting up the Development Environment:**
   - Installed necessary files, tools, and dependencies.
   - Ensured the server and client applications were running without issues.

2. **Fixing the Broken Datafeed Script:**
   - Made adjustments to the `client.py` (or `client3.py` for Python 3) script.
   - Modified `getDataPoint`, `getRatio`, and `main` methods as per the provided instructions.
   - Corrected the calculation of stock prices and ratios to ensure accurate data representation.

3. **Bonus: Adding Unit Tests:**
   - Implemented unit tests in the `client_test.py` file to cover `getDataPoint` and `getRatio` methods.
   - Utilized the Build-Act-Assert pattern to design effective test scenarios.
   - Ensured proper handling of edge cases such as division by zero.

## Conclusion
This internship task provided valuable insights into software engineering practices within the finance industry. By completing Task 1, I gained hands-on experience in data visualization, debugging, and unit testing. I look forward to applying these skills in future projects and contributing effectively to a dynamic team environment.
