# JPMorgan Chase & Co. Virtual Internship Project

Welcome to the JPMorgan Chase & Co. Virtual Internship Project! This project simulated real-world scenarios encountered in trading analysis and stock price monitoring. It provided hands-on experience with various technologies commonly used in the financial industry.

## Overview

The project consists of multiple tasks aimed at setting up a system to access and adjust data feeds, visualizing data for traders, and implementing trading strategies. Throughout the internship, I've worked on enhancing a web application's functionality and user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Utilized for data processing and analysis tasks.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Used for frontend development and interacting with the web application.
- **React**: Framework for building user interfaces.
- **Perspective**: Library for interactive data visualization.
- **Git**: Version control system for managing project files and collaboration.
